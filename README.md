## My process

This challenge has been a bit hard because of problems with the layout... but overall, I used the experience from my last challenge (the QR card), which helped greatly with this one.

I simply laid out all the content in HTML, made my mental scheme of how the CSS should work in a general way, and started! This time I haven't used pen and paper, which I generally like to do with CSS...

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS properties and heavy use of box model
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me learning how to better lay out mentally the structure of a layout.

Also, I'm learning how and when to properly commit changes to git.

### Continued development

I want to eventually start working with full layouts... but one step at a time.

### Useful resources

- [AlexCG's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfDqFArJnYA) - I'm currently using this resource to learn CSS.
- The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) have been, as always, crucial.
- I took the font from [this solution](https://jazzy-swan-796ba6.netlify.app/).

## Acknowledgments

As I already said, Jordan Alexander's (AlexCG) course is being incredibly helpful! Also, I have some Flexbox notions from Colt Steele's incredible [Udemy bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

Obviously, I want to thank Frontend Mentor for making these incredibl learning projects. :)
